# Find a Surgon

Implement a web application to allow patients to request appointments for doctors.

## What does the web do?

The app must fetch from an API.
Render the doctors information on the home page. Required information is: Picture, name and city.
Add a filter that allows the user to search by name any doctor.
If the user search an unexistant doctor a non found page will appeard.
The filter must work either if the user writes with caps on or not.
I add some styles (don't blame me, I'm not a designer)
Use grid for the character list.
Make it responsive.
If the user goes to unexistant pages we must give a proper feedback.
Add an extra filter to search by gender.

## Built with

- Visual Code Studio: as code editor
- SASS
- React

## Can you help me to improve?

I am a lawyer turned front-end developer so I still have a lot to learn. Any ideas or suggestions are welcome.
